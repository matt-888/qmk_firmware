// Split hand detection. The PCB has a matrix-grid circuit (lROW2/lCOL3 via
// lD33, left half only), but the sense path crosses two diodes in series
// (lD33 plus the shared duplex column diode lD37), leaving the read pin at
// ~1.0-1.4V — marginal against the RP2040 input threshold — so
// SPLIT_HAND_MATRIX_GRID GP26, GP6 misreads on production boards. Until a PCB
// rev lands the hand diode directly on the column pin, detect the hand from
// the fitted PMW3360 instead (this variant only ships a right-side ball); see
